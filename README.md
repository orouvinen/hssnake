# HsWorm

HsWorm is the classic worm game in a simple text-based form.
The main purpose for the game was to have a learning project in Haskell.

You should be able to clone the repository and build the project
with ```stack build``` and then run the game with  ```stack exec hsworm-exe```.
(I have only tested this under Linux.)


## Controls & playing

Collect an omnom and score a point.
Bump into a wall or into your own tail - game over.
